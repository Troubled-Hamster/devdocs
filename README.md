### Context

As software engineers, documentation can be hard to understand. It can be poorly written and lacking in examples. To solve this problem, we intend to use the wisdom of the crowd to supplement and clarify the documentation.

### How it works

Users can browse library documentation on our web application. Selecting a method from a library will load relevant code examples, Stack Overflow resources, and user questions and answers alongside the documentation.
